; Note
;  This function requires CORCON register to be setup in a certain state
;  in order to operate correctly. Due to this requirement, this function
;  will save the CORCON register on the stack in the beginning of the
;  function and restore it before the function return.
;  After saving the CORCON register, this function writes to all bits of
;  the CORCON register. Thus, for the brief duration when this function is
;  executing, the state of CORCON register may be different from its state
;  as set by the function caller. This may change the CPU core behavior with
;  respect to exception processing latency, DO loop termination, CPU interrupt
;  priority level and DSP-engine behavior.
